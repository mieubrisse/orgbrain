OrgBrain Overview
-----------------
* You are in a competitive environment
* In a competitive environment, the most effective actor wins and the others die
* The most effective actor is the one who navigates reality most efficiently to achieve their aims
* Efficient navigation of reality = maximizing the upside and minimizing the downside of events
* A good plan increases efficiency because it positions the actor to take advantage of good things and mitigate bad things (an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure)
* However, reality ALWAYS generates events that aren't in the plan (Black Swans)
* Therefore, the most efficient actor builds a plan that:
    * Is executed
    * Maximizes the upside & minimize downside of foreseen events
    * Maximizes the upside & minimize downside of unforeseen events
    * Extracts lessons from unforeseen events
    * Quickly updates to incorporate the lessons of unforeseen events
    * Persists the lessons for reference in the future
* Thus, the most efficient actor must be excellent at:
    * Storing & retrieving information
    * Executing processes
    * Hypothesizing
    * Reflecting
* Computers are very good at storing & retrieving information and executing processes, while humans are very good at hypothesizing and reflecting
* Thus, the most efficient actor is one that can best utilize the strengths of both humans and computers
* OrgBrain is a formula for using humans and computers to build the best plans possible

Competition
-----------
* Competitive have a special "no bullshit" property - what you say doesn't matter at all; what you do matters for everything
* In competitive environments, resources are the currency - e.g.:
    * Time
    * Money
    * People
    * Physical objects (e.g. factories, raw materials)
    * Mindshare
    * Physical terrain
    * Points
* Events change the balance of resources
* "Maximizing the upside and minimizing the downside" of an event can therefore be calculated in the resources relevant to the domain...
* ...but time is always the underlying resource, because time can yield all others
* Therefore, we focus on maximizing time gained and minimizing time spent

Components Of A Good Plan
-------------------------
### Is executed
* If the actor can't recall or reference the plan, it can't be executed
* If the actor recalls it but just doesn't do it, it doesn't give any benefit
* If the actor executes it imperfectly, it loses efficacy

### Maximizes the upside & minimize downside of foreseen events
* The actor should better position itself and its resources w/r/t foreseen events
* This means changing the balance of the actor's resources to take advantage of expected outcomes
* E.g. if the actor's chess opponent is known to leave a certain hole in his defense, the actor should position his pieces to take advantage of this
* E.g. if the opponent is prone to attempting a specific attack, the actor should defend against this

### Maximizes the upside & minimize downside of unforeseen events
* Unlike foreseen events, the actor cannot position resources for this
* Instead, optimizing unforeseen events relate to the actors' resources' _exposure_
* E.g. a trader who writes an uncovered call option is getting a fixed premium for an unbounded risk
* The best strategy here is to look for positive asymmetry - fixed downside, unbounded upside
* Likewise, symmetric and fixed upside/unbounded downside risk should be avoided

### Extracts lessons from unforeseen events
* Unforeseen events should be mulled over and distilled into lessons

### Quickly updates to incorporate the lessons
* After lessons are extracted, the plan must be updated to incorporate these lessons
* The execution of the plan must update after this!

### Persists the lessons for the future
* Lessons are no good if they aren't available for future planning
* Lessons should be persisted in a way that's accessible

Information Storage
-------------------
* Many of the above plan components require an information storage system
* **The best information storage system is easy to add to, and easy to retrieve from**
* Computers are exceptional at this (not forgetting), and humans are terrible
* The fundamental problem of information storage: there are infinite dimensions to group information by
* E.g. does "2021-Q3 Planning" get categorized under "Quarterly Goals", "2021", "Plannings", or maybe some of the categories included in the document (e.g. the client being planned for)?
* Hierarchical structures (e.g. folders, projects) are inherently flawed because they require:
    * The information creator to predict, in advance, all the different groupings
    * The information retriever to guess which groupings the information creator decided to use
* Better are labels: each piece of information can get tagged with arbitrary numbers of dimensions
    * These still suffer from the problem of category creation, and creators needing to crawl through every tag and guess whether the tag is applicable
* Best is dump-and-semantic-search: the information creator purely creates the information without organizing it, the information retriever queries for what they want, and the information system is intelligent enough to bring back the relevant results
* Links between documents are very important

Execution
---------
* Executing an outcome = applying a transformation to reality's state = getting from state A -> B = **doing some verb**
* Therefore, any execution step MUST start with a verb "Run.." "Change.." "Pick..."
    * This is as true if the execution is running on a computer as if a human is executing it
* If:
    * Steps from A->B have unknowns -> fractal outcomes
    * Steps from A->B are known, and would cost more to automate than to have a human do -> checklist ("human code")
    * Steps from A->B are known, and would benefit from automating -> computer code
