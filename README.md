OrgBrain: A New Model For Execution
===================================
What is it?
-----------
OrgBrain is a powerful model for execution that works at both individual and organizational scales. It was discovered through experiences [Kevin Today](https://github.com/mieubrisse) and [Galen Marchetti](https://github.com/galenmarchetti) had working on teams at Palantir Technologies and [Kurtosis Technologies](https://www.kurtosistech.com/). It aims to fix the problems with modern [Agile software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), and stands on the shoulders of the following giants:

* [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) (and specifically Gene Kim's take in [The Phoenix Project](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17255186-the-phoenix-project?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=FvfRHK0rh7&rank=1))
* David Allen's [Getting Things Done](https://gettingthingsdone.com/)
* Nassim Taleb's [Black Swan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) and [Antifragility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragility) theories
* John Boyd's [maneuver warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuver_warfare) and [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) ideas

To learn OrgBrain, go through the following:

3. Organizational Memory

Why?
----
Modern software development companies do many things right. Before the mid 2000's, software companies released monolithic pieces of code - often annual releases - built in large orgs of departments that passed the software from stage to stage. This was the [Waterfall development ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model), founded in the same "large batch" mindset that manufacturers had before the [Toyota Production System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Production_System) revolution. Software developed in large batches had the same problems as manufacturing: slow time to market, slow time to fix bugs, and time wasted building features customers don't want. Much like the small-batch Toyota Production System proved to outcompete large-batch manufacturers as Boyd's maneuver warfare predicts, the Agile method with its small batches and rapid cycle times arrived to the software world to outcompete Waterfall.

The best companies in the software development world have largely adopted Agile. Teams are small, execution is done in sprints, and shipping quickly is a focus. Yet, our orgs still struggle to connect higher-level strategy with tactical sprints. We know that small, agile teams deliver the best software, but how do we ensure their weekly sprints are aligned with higher-level goals? Organizations usually fall somewhere along this spectrum:

* Let tactical teams do as they please, and suffer the chaos and reap the gains that come as a result
* Dictate strategy top-down (usually on the quarterly level), which inevitably falls by the wayside when unexpected problems arise

Why is this so hard? Taleb gives us the answer: reality generates Black Swans, those unforeseen and extremely impactful events that throw all plans awry. When a team is small and its plans local, the reality it's working with is fairly uncomplex - Black Swans aren't as likely, and the team can flow quickly around any obstacles that do arise. When scale rises, complexity increases, and projections stretch to 3, 6, or 12 months in advance, even a small detour early on can cause huge ramifications.

OrgBrain aims to do better.

What's with the name?
---------------------
We realized that an organization, like a human, has a brain of memories, goals, and plans. It takes action in order to realize its aims, and must learn from its contact with reality. It's clear that the most effective organizations are the ones that learn the quickest and remember the most, but the tactics for achieving this are anything but. OrgBrain is a pattern for organizing a brain for maximum effectiveness (be it individual or organizational). OrgBrain.
