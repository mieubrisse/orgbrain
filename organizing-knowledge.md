* Heuristic for documents in the knowledge store:
    * Will we be updating/modifying this in 6 months? -> it's evergreen; goes in general reference
    * In 6 months, will this only be used for reference? -> it's temporal; goes in project support
* Knowledge organization is descriptive, not prescriptive
    * Get it out of your head and into A place (important part is having a link you can share with other people)
* The idea is to be iterative: you make a super janky, hacky version and then you refine it as you use it
    * Don't have to worry about "will this become a dead tracker?" because if it does in the future, we'll just clean it
* As you reference that document more and more, it gains more power and momentum (e.g. how the Style Guide and Onboarding Checklist were built)
* DON'T spend a lot of time designing folder structures in advance, because:
    1. Hierarchical folder structures are inherently flawed due to the multi-dimnesion problem: https://asistdl.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/meet.2008.1450450214 
    1. Tags are strictly better because they allow categorizing information by multiple dimensions
* The takeaway: invest VERY hard in good labelling & powerful search engines, and very little in hierarchical folder structures
