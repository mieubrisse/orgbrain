Fractal Outcomes
================

Uncertainty
-----------
* Human code works well when the path is already trodden
    * Put in X work, get Y output
* When doing something never done before, it's harder to use
    * Don't know what's going to happen - Black Swans could throw everything off
* Introduce notions of input/output uncertainty
    * Checklist is high input/output certainty
* What does low input/output certainty look like?
* Forest analogy:
    * Our top-level outcome is clear - get to the town on the other side of the forest
    * How we get there is not - we have several trail options in front of us
    * The very next step (what GTD calls the "Next Action") IS clear - it's to take a step
    * But in which direction do we go?
    * Form several hypotheses
    * Take your best guess given current knowledge, and take a step in that direction
    * If this way looks promising, keep going
    * If the way seems to take you away from the direction of the town, you backtrack and choose another hypothesis
* This is how humans naturally navigate!
* Contact with reality _will_ yield unexpected results - a way that's looked promising for the best 15 minutes could suddenly dead-end, meaning your top hypothesis is now your bottom hypothesis and you need to switch
    * These are Taleb's Black Swans

Past approaches at handling uncertainty
---------------------------------------
* Both Agile and GTD recognize the folly of rigidly defining the future
    * GTD has Next Actions, Agile works in short sprints
* Both Agile and GTD don't have a good way for handling the steps beyond the immediate
    * How do you plan for the steps beyond the immediate?
    * Both use the notion of "projects", and both suffer from the same flaws
        * What does a project for "Mom's birthday" mean? When is it done?
        * When is "Prod database upgrade" done?
* Common, bad e.g. as the result of a quarterly planning document:
```
### P1 - Prod Database Upgrade
* New servers
    * 12 x R420s
    * Kevin
    * Galen
    * Need to get in touch with Marco
* Software
    * James
    * Alex
    * Get in touch with vendor
        * Ask for discount
            * $500 last year
            * $2000 next year
        * Blocked on budget increase approval

### P2 - Audit logging
* Steve
* Code changes
* Deploy
* QA
```
* Main problem: "project" becomes this broad, reified concept, exempt from the human code rules about specificity and actionability and supplemental information
* People do this because:
    1. They know uncertainty exist, so they make a broad bucket to attempt to handle changes
    2. They don't want to change the plan
    3. They think "projects" are separate from "tasks"

A better way
------------
* As we've seen, this isn't how humans actually navigate
    * Instead, you form hypotheses, test those hypotheses by exploring the highest-conviction one, and keep hitting unexpected events and backtracking and iterating until you eventually arrive at your destination
* All the points along the way - both one step in front of you, and ten steps, and ten miles - are just hypothesized outcomes reach serving a larger outcome
    * Each journey is just a bunch of smaller journeys
    * It's _fractal_
* We've used human code for reaching high-certainty outcomes
* We can extend it for navigating high-uncertainty situations with Fractal Outcomes
    * Everything is an outcome, and is NOT exempt from the rules of human coding
        * No distinction between tasks and projects
    * Every outcome is a hypothesis, that may be changed
    * Because every outcome is a hypothesis, the 
    * Subtasks answer "how"
* E.g. in forest example:
```
* [ ] Arrive
* [ ] Take the northernmost
* [ ] 
```
* This means that:
    * We 
    * 


* Projects are exempted from the human code rules, which means they can't be marked as definitively done
    * This happens in a mistaken desire to not change the plans
    * This creates anxiety in humans, and deprives them of the satisfaction of completing a thing
* Most things aren't actionable
* Supplementary information is all mixed up with instructions
* This is often done in a mistaken desire to never change the plan
* Longer-term plans should be living documents

* Projects and tasks are the same thing - just outcomes!

* Hypotheses are tested by executing substeps
* Key elements:
    * Everything is a hypothesis
* Apply analogy 

* Point out that any instruction/action is taking the world from one state transition to another
    * This is why starting with verbs works
* Introduce analogy of walking through forest
* Grind-renavigate
