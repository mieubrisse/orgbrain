Underlying Principles
=====================
This document makes several assertions about the best way to run an organization. This document lays those axioms out.

Only contact with reality demonstrates efficacy
-----------------------------------------------
If you are engaged in a competitive pursuit - business, trading, sport, fighting - then you are subject to Darwinian pressure to win or die. Naturally, you should judge your actions by whether they help you win. This sounds obvious, yet we see the opposite all the time: 

* Businesses burning days creating a Big Yearly Plan that gets thrown out the window in the first 3 months when something unexpected arises (why keep wasting the time?)
* Traders who expose themselves to huge risk, confident their Achilles heel will "never happen" (what about when it does?)
* Martial artists who spend years training a discipline without ever sparring (how do you know it works in a real fight?)
* Soldiers adhering to outdated dogma from the last war on a different continent on different terrain (why keep doing what doesn't work?)

All the examples above demonstrate humans overestimating their predictive power. We plan because it gives us a feeling of safety, and a plan is definitely better than no plan. Danger arises when we're 

Let humans and computers do what they're respectively good at
-------------------------------------------------------------
Humans are very good at associative, generative thinking - drawing inferences, spotting patterns, coming up with ideas, forming hypotheses, etc. They are very bad at precise execution & information storage, and tend to get bored when forced to do these things. Computers, conversely, execute instructions and store information without fail or complaint, but are terrible at generative thinking.

OrgBrain asserts that we should lean on computers as much as possible for process & data storage, so that computers can spend as much of their time as possible ideating.

Contact with reality yields uncertainty
---------------------------------------
Standard U.S. military knowledge holds that no plan survives contact with the enemy, and Mike Tyson said that everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Both Tyson and the military are penalized tremendously for doing things that don't yield effective outcomes, 

You must have skin in the game
